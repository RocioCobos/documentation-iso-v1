# Travelgate Documenation

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/)

## Requirements
* Node.js version 18 or above

## Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Generate GraphQL API reference

```
npx docusaurus graphql-to-doc
```

The GraphQL API reference is generated from the TravelgateX GraphQL schema but 
the `sidebar-schema.js` needs to be updated. Copy + paste the following code in your 
`api/sidebar-schema.js` file:

```javascript
/** @type {import('@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs').SidebarsConfig} */

module.exports = {
    schemaSidebar: [
        {
            type: "autogenerated",
            dirName: ".",
        },
    ],
};
```


## Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build (optional)

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Test `.mdx` structure before commit/push

```bash
npx docusaurus-mdx-checker
```
