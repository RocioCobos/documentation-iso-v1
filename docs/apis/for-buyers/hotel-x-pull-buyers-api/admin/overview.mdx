# Overview

In the [Key Concepts](../../../../get-started/key-concepts) section, we introduced you to the fundamental entities (`access`, `supplier`, `context`...) that enable you to establish and manage connections with your Partners. Now, with the Admin API, you have the power to access a comprehensive list of all available entities within your organization, ensuring seamless connectivity.

In this section, you will find:

- **List of Accesses:** Obtain a complete list of `accesses`, a critical component for successful interaction with your Partners. 

- **List of Suppliers:** Access a detailed directory of `suppliers` code and its `context`, providing you with the necessary information to create your plugins files if you want to use them.

The Admin API serves as your gateway to streamline access management and supplier information, facilitating a more efficient and effective experience within the Hotel-X ecosystem.
