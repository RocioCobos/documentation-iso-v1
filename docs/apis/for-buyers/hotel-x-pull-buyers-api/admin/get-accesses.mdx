# Get Accesses

The `allAccesses` query provides you with all your available accesses and their basic information. Remember that an `access` is the set of credentials and authentication configuration that enables a Buyer to connect to a Seller.

### Simple Accesses Request

When performing a simple `allAccesses` request, the following fields will be returned for all your accesses:

* `name`
* `isActive`
* `code`


<GraphqlSample query={allAccessesListQuery}/>


### Advanced Accesses Request

If you want to obtain detailed information about each access, you can request additional fields, allowing you to access the parameters contained within each access.

* `name`
* `isActive`
* `code`
* `supplier`
* `isTest`
* `user`
* `password`
* `urls`
* `parameters`

<GraphqlSample query={allAccessesDetailQuery}/>
