# Commission

Commission plugin defines the contracted/expected commission in cases where the Supplier is not able to send it via integration. The commission loaded in the SFTP is considered as a Gross commission, meaning that the commission or profit is already included in the price.

To get started with the Commission plugin, follow these simple steps:

## 1. Create and Upload your Commission File

To get started, create your commission file in the correct format and then upload it to your SFTP account. We've provided a template file below ‚¨áÔ∏è to help you with this process. Just click on the file name, add your own rules, save it in CSV format, and then upload it to the corresponding folder in your SFTP.

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

üìÅHotelX  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìÅHotelX_0000  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìÅBusinessRules  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **üìÑ[RequestContext_sequential_commission.csv](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/BuyerContext_sequential_commission.csv)**

* If you use the Supplier context (single mode search) you will need to load 1 file for each supplier with the Supplier context in the name (SupplierContext_sequential_commission.csv).
