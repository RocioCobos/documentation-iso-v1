# Virtual Credit Card

The Virtual Credit Card plugin allows you to connect with a VCC supplier who can create virtual credit cards for you at the time of reservation. For each hotel booking where you indicate the plugin, our system will connect with your VCC supplier to obtain the virtual credit card and use this information to complete the reservation with the hotel supplier.

Virtual Credit Card plugin adds the possibility to:

* **Create a virtual credit card (VCCGen):** The VCC generator plugin empowers Buyers to generate virtual credit cards featuring activation and expiration dates of their choosing. You can apply rules using the `genvcc.csv` rules file to determine whether or not to utilize a specific VCC. This decision is based on the rules defined within the file and the parameters specified in the request.

* **Cancel a virtual credit card (VCCCan):** The VCC cancel plugin is responsible for cancelling a virtual credit card identified by the id returned in the book response. The service will return the status of the payment card inside status field. This plugin should be utilized exclusively within the [Cancel](../booking-management/cancel) operation, contingent on the successful completion of the booking cancellation. To specify the virtual credit card to be used for cancellation, a rule that returns an access key will be employed, utilizing the same rule file as the VCC generator. You can establish rules within the `genvcc.csv` rule file to determine the utilization of a particular VCC based on rules within the file and request parameters.


:::warning Bear in mind
You need to have an agreement with a VCC supplier integrated with TravelgateX to start using this plugin. Please check our [VCC Payments article](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/getting-started-as-a-new-buyer/how-to-activate-vcc-payments) to learn all the steps before configuring the plugin in your book mutations.

:::caution

Bear in mind that this file is a collection of rules and we chose in every Book **the first rule that matches the criteria sent in the Query**. You should specify the more restrictive rules on the top of the file. If there is no value for any rule criteria row, it means that any value in the request matches this row. It is important to indicate the contexts used in values on the rule criteria to improve rule matching.

### GenVCC

Once you've uploaded your genvcc file, to use the plugin add the following field to the `settings` node of your request. Note that genvcc plugin can just be executed in `book` `mutation`. In order to successfully execute the genvcc plugin, you will need to create the request with the following variables.

* **`step`**: "REQUEST"
* **`type`**: "PRE_STEP"
* **`name`**: "genvcc"
* **`parameters`**:

| Key              | Value         | Description                                                                    | Default Value (if not sent) | Mandatory |
|------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| `activationDate` | yyyy/mm/dd    | Represents the date when the virtual credit card will be activated             | Same day as the book        | NO        |
| `expirationDate` | yyyy/mm/dd    | Represents the date when the virtual credit card will expire                   | One month after check in    | NO        |
| `useGross`       | true or false | Allows to choose the origin of the card amount. The option‚Äôs gross or the net. | Net option‚Äôs value          | NO        |

```js
"settings": {
    "plugins" : [
        {
            "step" : "REQUEST",
            "pluginsType" : {
                "type" : "PRE_STEP",
                "name" : "genvcc",
                "parameters" : [
                    {
                        "key" : "activationDate",
                        "value" : "yyyy-mm-dd"
                    },
                    {
                        "key" : "expirationDate",
                        "value" : "yyyy-mm-dd"
                    },
                    {
                        "key" : "useGross",
                        "value" : "true"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

:::danger

Please note, if your reservation fails due to connection or supplier error, a VCC (Virtual Credit Card) might still be created. If you need to cancel this VCC, contact with your VCC supplier promptly.

:::

### CanVCC

In the case of canvcc, since it is a cancellation, there is no need to upload any file. You just have to indicate it in the request. Please note that the canvcc plugin can only be executed in the `cancel` `mutation`. To successfully execute the canvcc plugin, you will need to create the request with the following variables.

* **`step`**: `RESPONSE`
* **`type`**: `PRE_STEP`
* **`name`**: `canvcc`
* **`parameters`**:
    * **`id`**: The id of the virtual credit card that you want to cancel.
    * **`currency`**: (Optional) A currency can be added. This is particularly useful if you use different VCC accesses depending on the currency used. Currency code format must be ISO4217 code format (i.e. ‚ÄúEUR‚Äù, ‚ÄúUSD‚Äù, ‚ÄúGBP‚Äù,‚Ä¶)

```js
"settings" : {
    "plugins" : [
        {
            "step" : "RESPONSE",
            "pluginsType" : {
                "type" : "PRE_STEP",
                "name" : "canvcc",
                "parameters" : [
                    {
                        "key" : "id",
                        "value" : "virtualCreditCardID"
                    },
                    {
                        "key" : "currency",
                        "value" : "USD"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
