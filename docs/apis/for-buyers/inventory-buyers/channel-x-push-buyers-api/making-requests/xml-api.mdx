# Channel-X XML API

Channel-X Push Buyers API is a travel API based on XML. All requests are expected to be standard HTTP POST requests, with the POST body containing the XML request within a SOAP envelope.

In the Channel-X Push Buyers API framework, we push information regarding Availability, Rates, and Inventory (ARI) to your system. We will initiate this process by sending you a request containing the relevant data. If the operation goes well, we expect a sucess response from your end; otherwise, we anticipate receiving an error notification.
