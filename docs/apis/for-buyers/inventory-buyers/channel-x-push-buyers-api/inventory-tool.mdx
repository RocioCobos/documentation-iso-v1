# Inventory Tool

Since Channel-X solution is integrated with Inventory Tool, first of all you must use our [Inventory extranet](https://inventory.xmltravelgate.com/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f) in order to configure the setup for the hotels, rate plans and rooms contracted with the hoteliers, so that your Channel Managers can map them as well. Once mapped, the Channel Manager will load and update availability and prices for the hotels, rate plans and rooms configured.

To learn how to setup hotels, rate plans, and rooms in the Inventory Tool, please refer to the [Inventory SetUp section](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/set-up/overview).

After completing this preliminary step, you will be able to perform a [Full Copy](fullcopy-and-deltas). From that point onward, you will receive smaller requests, known as [Deltas](fullcopy-and-deltas), to stay informed about updates.
