# Overview

In the case of the Channel-X API, Travelgate will send requests to the Buyer's system, to your system. This API has three main methods; your task will be to configure your system to handle the requests of each of the methods:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.filter((item, i) => i > 0)}/>

After each request, a response should be provided from your side. For instance, if a `HotelAvailNotif` request is received, a corresponding `HotelAvailNotif` response should be sent, and so forth. There are two response options, success or error.

Keep in mind that after configuring your system to handle the requests, you will need to access the [Full Copy tab](../fullcopy-and-deltas.mdx) to obtain all product details. Subsequently, Channel-X will send [Delta](../fullcopy-and-deltas.mdx) requests for updates made by the Channel Manager.
