:::danger Deprecated API

The Legacy Pull Buyers API, our initial Buyers API launched in 2012, is now deprecated and should not be further developed. Instead, we introduced the [Hotel-X Buyers API](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) in 2017, which serves as the sole API for new Buyers looking to integrate and participate in our Marketplace.

# Legacy Buyers XML API

Legacy Pull Buyers API is a travel API based on XML. All requests are expected to be standard HTTP POST requests, with the POST body containing the XML request within a SOAP envelope.

In the Legacy Pull Buyers API framework, you will need to submit a request to Travelgate's system. Subsequently, Travelgate will validate the format and forward it to the Seller's endpoint. The Seller will receive the request, generate a response, and send it back, once again forwarding it to Travelgate, which will, in turn, relay it to the Buyer; that is, to you.
