:::danger Deprecated API

The Legacy Pull Buyers API, our initial Buyers API launched in 2012, is now deprecated and should not be further developed. Instead, we introduced the [Hotel-X Buyers API](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) in 2017, which serves as the sole API for new Buyers looking to integrate and participate in our Marketplace.

# Overview

In order to book a hotel room, booking flow methods must be executed sequentially: `Avail`, `Valuation` and `Reservation`.
