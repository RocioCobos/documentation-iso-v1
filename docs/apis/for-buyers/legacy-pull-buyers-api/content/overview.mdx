:::danger Deprecated API

The Legacy Pull Buyers API, our initial Buyers API launched in 2012, is now deprecated and should not be further developed. Instead, we introduced the [Hotel-X Buyers API](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) in 2017, which serves as the sole API for new Buyers looking to integrate and participate in our Marketplace.

# Overview

The Content methods provide access to essential static information from Sellers, including details like hotel and destination lists. To effectively manage these methods, familiarize yourself with calls such as `HotelList`, `CategoryList`, `GeographicalDestinationTree`, `RoomList`, `MealPlanList`, and `MetaData`.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.filter((item, i) => i > 0)}/>
