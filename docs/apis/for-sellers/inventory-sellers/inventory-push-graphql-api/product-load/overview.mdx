## Methods

The Hotel Push Sellers API allows to both push and retrieve information related to Availability, Rates, and Inventory (ARI).

When pushing data, you need to submit requests with the specific product information you intend to push. For data retrieval, you must send requests to obtain information stored in Travelgate's system, and in response, you will receive the requested data.

As a result, here are the specific methods you need to implement:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.filter((item, i) => i > 0)}/>
