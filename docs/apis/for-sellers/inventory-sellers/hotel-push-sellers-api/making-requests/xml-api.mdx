# Push Sellers API XML API

Hotel Push Sellers API is a travel API based on XML. All requests are expected to be standard HTTP POST requests, with the POST body containing the XML request within a SOAP envelope.

In the context of the Hotel Push Sellers API, you can both push and retrieve information about Availability, Rates, and Inventory (ARI):

* When you **push** data, you'll need to submit a request to Travelgate's system with all the necessary information about inventory, availability or rate. If everything goes smoothly, you'll receive a successful response and the data will be stored in a Travelgate database; otherwise, you'll receive an error message.

* On the other hand, when you **retrieve** data, you'll need to send a request to Travelgate's system to get the information you're looking for. If everything goes well, we'll send you the data that was previously stored in our system as a response; otherwise, we'll notify you of an error.
