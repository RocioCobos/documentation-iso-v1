# Overview

The Hotel Push Sellers API allows to both push and retrieve information related to Availability, Rates, and Inventory (ARI). 

**When pushing data**, you need to submit requests with the specific product information you intend to push. **For data retrieval**, you must send requests to obtain information stored in Travelgate's system, and in response, you will receive the requested data.

As a result, here are the specific methods you need to implement:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.filter((item, i) => i > 0)}/>
