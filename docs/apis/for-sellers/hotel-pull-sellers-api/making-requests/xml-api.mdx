# Legacy Sellers XML API

Legacy Pull Sellers API is a travel API based on XML. All requests are expected to be standard HTTP POST requests, with the POST body containing the XML request within a SOAP envelope.

In the Legacy Pull Sellers API framework, The Buyer will need to submit a request to Travelgate's system. Subsequently, Travelgate will validate the format and forward it to the Seller's endpoint. The Seller will receive the request, generate a response following Travelgate API, and send it back, once again forwarding it to Travelgate, which will, in turn, relay it to the Buyer.
