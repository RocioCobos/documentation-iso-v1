# Legacy Sellers Request Headers

The following HTTP request headers are essential for all request methods and must be included in every POST request.


**Content Type**: Content-Type header provides with the actual content type of the returned content. In this case, the header is set to:

```html
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
```  


**Request Pre-Approval**: In HTTP, it signals to the server that the client seeks approval before transmitting the request body, and a 100 (Continue) response indicates permission to proceed.

```html
Expect: 100-continue
```                           


**Content Format**: Specifies the expected content format, specifically requesting content in XML format in this instance.

```html
Accept: application/xml
```              


**Gzip Compression**: In order to increase performance and save bandwidth, all the live traffic must enable GZIP compression in the HTTP header. 

```html
Accept-Encoding: gzip
```             


**Keep Alive**: In order to increase performance and improve response times, you can add the keep-alive header to all our transactions. 

```html
Connection: Keep-Alive 
```
