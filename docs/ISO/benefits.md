## Secure information
ISO 27001 helps protect all forms of information whether digital, paper-based, or cloud-hosted.

## Protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data
ISO 27001 helps to ensure that information is:
* **Confidential** Not available or disclosed to unauthorized people entities or processes.  
* **Whole** Complete and accurate, and protected from corruption.
* **Available** Accessible and usable when authorized users require it.

## Comply with business, legal, contractual and regulatory requirements
ISO 27001 certification is also in line with rigid regulatory requirements such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the NIS Directive (Directive on security of network and information systems), and other cyber security laws.
