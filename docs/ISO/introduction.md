# What is ISO 27001?

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent nongovernmental organization that publishes standards in technical and nontechnical fields. The ISO/IEC 27001 series of standards is a joint effort with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and defines mechanisms to help organizations keep information assets secure.

The ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (ISO 27001) standard provides guidance for developing an Information Security Management System (ISMS), a risk-based system through which an organization can design, implement, maintain and continually improve its information security over time. 

The ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard includes best practice guidance from ISO/IEC 27001:2022. 

A subsequent standard, ISO/IEC 27001:2022, provides additional guidelines for implementing a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS).
