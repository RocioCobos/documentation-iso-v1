# Reports

Reports generate CSV files with information about your product. Currently, there are reports for hotel blacklists, supplier blacklists, and hotels. The hotel blacklist report also includes information on the reasons why these hotels are blacklisted (such as blacklisted destination, chain, market, etc.).

You can generate as many reports as you want, but there is a limit of one per report type every 5 minutes. Reports are stored for 3 months before they are deleted. When you click the `Generate report` button, the report will begin generating. You will receive a notification on the screen when the report is finished, and you will need to refresh the page to see it.

To download any of the reports, you can use the Download button in the Download column.
