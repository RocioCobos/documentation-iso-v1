### Hotels

Search hotels allows you to search for hotels in your system using different filters. To do this, click on the Filter button and select one of the following search fields:

* Hotel Name
* Hotel Code
* Hotel Chain
* Destination 
* Country Code.

Here is an example of how to search for hotels by name. First, choose the "Name" filter. Then, click "Add filter" to add the filter to your search. Finally, enter the name of the hotel you are looking for and click "Search". You can specify as many filters as you need.

You will be able to add providers using the extranet or a [master file](#). To add a provider you can click on the `+` button. You need to indicate the following information:

* Code: The provider (supplier) code in the Travelgate platform.
* Name: The provider name you want to have for this supplier in the extranet.
* Direct: Specify whether the supplier is direct or a third-party supplier. This will be useful when you add rules in Distribution and want to filter by provider, because you will be able to indicate a specific provider or all providers that are "Third" or "Direct".
