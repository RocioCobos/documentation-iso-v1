# Overview

The distribution extranet provides a centralized platform for managing the business configuration of your organization and its corresponding agencies (Buyers). You will have access to a variety of tools, components, and panels to create, modify, or edit business rules, add filters to your product, and more. You can also search for specific reservations and download monthly reports with all reservations.

Once you are logged in, you will be redirected to the home page or Landpage. In order to be able to see and access the different sections of the web you can display the left sidebar:
