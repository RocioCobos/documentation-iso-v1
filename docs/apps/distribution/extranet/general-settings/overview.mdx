# Overview

The distribution rules can be applied to organizations, agencies, or both. Some rules apply exclusively to organizations, while others apply exclusively to agencies. A few rules apply to both organizations and agencies.

You will find the following 4 sections in your “General Settings”:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.filter((item, i) => i > 0)}/>

You will be able to identify if these rules are applied to all your Organization (Configuration) or only to a specific Agency (Agency name) by checking the top menu.
