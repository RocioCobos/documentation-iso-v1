# Modifiers

## Maximum Time to Quote

![Distribution Modifiers](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/distribution_configuration-modifiers1.jpg)

With this rule it can be set the maximum time in minutes than can elapse between the execution of an availability search and the execution of the valuation of any of its selling options: if the elapsed minutes are greater than the maximum then the valuation can not be performed and an error is returned. If this rule is no set with a maximum value then the previous condition will not be applied.

By default the value for an agency inherits the one set on the general settings.

This rule can be set by `agency` or by `organization` on general settings: when defined by agency it can be chosen to set a concrete behaviour or to inherit the value set on the general settings.


## Maximum Time to Booking

With this rule it can be set the maximum time in minutes than can elapse between the execution of a valuation and the execution of its reservation: if the elapsed minutes are greater than the maximum then the valuation can not be performed and an error is returned. If this rule is no set with a maximum value then the previous condition will not be applied.

## Selling Release

![Distribution Modifiers](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/distribution_configuration-modifiers3.jpg)

If this rule is set with a value then it is applied the following condition to any selling for the agency: if the booking date is NOT included on the release (counting from the check-in date, inclusive) then it cannot be sold (*"No availability"* is returned). If this rule is no set with a value then the previous condition will not be applied. By default there is no *Selling Release* set for an agency.

Examples:

* If *"Selling Release"* is set to 0 then we can only sell on the same day of the check-in.
* If *"Selling Release"* is set to 1 then we can only sell on the same day of the check-in and one day before.
* If *"Selling Release"* is set to 5 then we can only sell on the same day of the check-in and up until five days before.

This rule can only be set by `agency`.

## Closing Release

![Distribution Modifiers](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/distribution_configuration-modifiers4.jpg)

If this rule is no set with a value then the previous condition will not be applied. By default there is no *Closing Release* set for an agency.
