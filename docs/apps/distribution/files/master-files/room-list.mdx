* If a room exists then it is updated.
* If a room does not exist then it is created.
* Existing rooms that are not referenced are not removed.
* If an existing room has to be removed from system then you have to contact with Travelgate.
* If there is any problem with a room's information then it is omitted (and logged) but the load continues.
