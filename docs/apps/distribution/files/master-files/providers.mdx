# Providers

Distribution Master files contain the product you will buy and sell in our Marketplace: hotels, mealplans and other required data to apply your business rules subsequently.

Create and update your providers.


## Create and Upload your Providers Master File

To get started, create your providers master file in the correct format and then upload it to your FTP account. We've provided a template file below ⬇️ to help you with this process. Just click on the file name, add your data, save it in CSV format, and then upload it to the corresponding folder in your FTP.

:::tip TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

* If a provider exists then it is updated.
* If a provider does not exist then it is created.
* Existing providers that are not referenced are not removed.
* If an existing provider has to be removed from system then you have to contact with Travelgate.
* If there is any problem with a provider's information then it is omitted (and logged) but the load continues.
