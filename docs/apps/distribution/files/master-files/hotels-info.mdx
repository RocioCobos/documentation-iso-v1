# Hotel Info

Distribution Master files contain the product you will buy and sell in our Marketplace: hotels, mealplans and other required data to apply your business rules subsequently.

On the HotelCode you'll need to add the same codes that you have specified or will specify in the [Mapping Files](../mapping-files/mapping).
