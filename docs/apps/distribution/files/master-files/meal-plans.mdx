# Meal Plans

Distribution Master files contain the product you will buy and sell in our Marketplace: hotels, mealplans and other required data to apply your business rules subsequently.

Create and configurate your meal plans.


## Create and Upload your Meal Plan Master File

To get started, create your meal plan master file in the correct format and then upload it to your FTP account. We've provided a template file below ⬇️ to help you with this process. Just click on the file name, add your data, save it in CSV format, and then upload it to the corresponding folder in your FTP.

:::tip TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

* If a meal plan exists then it is updated.
* If a meal plan does not exist then it is created.
* Existing meal plans that are not referenced are not removed.
* If an existing meal plan has to be removed from system then you have to contact with Travelgate.
* If there is any problem with a meal plan's information then it is omitted (and logged) but the load continues.
