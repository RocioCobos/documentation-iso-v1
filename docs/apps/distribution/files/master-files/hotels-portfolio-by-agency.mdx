# Hotels Portfolio by Agency

Distribution Master files contain the product you will buy and sell in our Marketplace: hotels, mealplans and other required data to apply your business rules subsequently.

Set concrete hotels portfolios by agency.


## Create and Upload your Hotels Portfolio by Agency Master File

To get started, create your hotels portfolio by agency master file in the correct format and then upload it to your FTP account. We've provided a template file below ‚¨áÔ∏è to help you with this process. Just click on the file name, add your data, save it in CSV format, and then upload it to the corresponding folder in your FTP.
