# Overview

Distribution Master files contain the product you will buy and sell in our Marketplace. It is necessary to create these files to add information to the Distribution extranet; the rules you will later apply on the website will be derived from this data.

Please note that creating and uploading the [Hotels Master file](hotels) is mandatory for working with Distribution.
