# Hotels

Distribution Master files contain the product you will buy and sell in our Marketplace: hotels, mealplans and other required data to apply your business rules subsequently.

Create and update your hotels.

On the HotelCode you'll need to add the same codes that you have specified or will specify in the [Mapping Files](../mapping-files/mapping).
