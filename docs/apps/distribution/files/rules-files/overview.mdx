# Overview


In addition to using the Distribution extranet, it's also possible to manage all the rules, pricing rules, filters, blacklists, etc., through files.

Note that for these rules to work, you'll first need to create the [Mapping](../mapping-files/mapping) and [Master files](../master-files/overview).

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.filter((item, i) => i > 0)}/>
