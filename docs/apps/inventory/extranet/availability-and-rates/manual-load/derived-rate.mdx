## Frequently Asked Questions

<summary>How can I create a discount or supplement using derived rates?</summary>
<p>In order to create discounts or supplements as early bird offers, non refundable discounts or gala extra you can use what we call derived rates. These are rates that descend from non-derived rates and they may or may not modify some of the values of the base rate, such as cancellation policies or markets</p>
<p>We are going to explain the process to add a derived rate using an example of creating an Early Bird discount:</p>

<b>Step 1: Derived Rate SetUp</b>
<p>First, it is necessary to create the Derived Rate in the SetUp section. Once there, select the hotel and click the Add Derived Rate button for the same rate for which you want to create a derived rate:</p>

![DerivedRate_FAQs_1](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/DerivedRate_FAQs_1.png)

<p>A pop up window will appear for you to fill in the derived rate information:</p>

![DerivedRate_FAQs_2](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/DerivedRate_FAQs_2.jpg)

<p>In our example we have created a derived rate specifying its code and name as a discount and we’ve indicated that we only want this discount to be applied to our ‘Double room’. All other conditions will remain the same as its base rate.</p>

<b>Step 2: Derived Rate Price and Availability Load</b>
<p>Next step will be to add the discount or supplement and the availability conditions for your derived rate in the ‘Manual Load’ section:</p>

![DerivedRate_FAQs_3](https://storage.travelgate.com/docs/DerivedRate_FAQs_3.png)

<p>Select your Derived Rated and load the date range that this discount/supplement will be applied and the sort of adjustment type (Type adjust amount) to apply with its value (Adjust Amount). The adjust type is either percentage or amount.</p>

<p>The four possible combinations will be:</p>

<b>1.Percent supplement: Type adjust: Percent + Percent Adjust Amount: Integer positive value.</b>
<p>This means that a supplement has been applied equal to the amount calculated, based on the percentage introduced, over the final price.</p>

<b>2.Percent discount: Type adjust Amount: Percent + Adjust Amount: Integer negative value</b>
<p>This means that a discount has been applied equal to the amount calculated, based on the percentage introduced, over the final amount.</p>

<b>3.Amount supplement: Type adjust Amount: Amount + Adjust Amount: Integer positive value</b>
<p>This means that a supplement has been applied equal to the amount introduced to the final amount.</p>

<b>4.Amount discount: Type adjust Amount: Amount + Adjust Amount: Integer negative value</b>
<p>This means that a discount has been applied equal to the amount introduced to the final amount.</p>

<p>If you want the derived rate to have a discount or offer applied to it, you will have to introduce a negative value. To do so you must introduce a minus before the value.</p>

<p>In this example, we have loaded availability and conditions for our ‘Early Bird Discount 10%’. The discount will be available all February, applying a 10% discount and only if the release is 60 days before the check in day.</p>

<p>Once you have created your discount/supplement you will be able to check this information in the Calendar section as follows:</p>
