## Booking List

The Booking List tool allows you to retrieve a list of the bookings made in a particular hotel. You must introduce the client and the Channel Manager, the hotel and the filter parameters to search the bookings that meet the conditions.

It is possible to filter by dates or locator. In case of filtering by date, you will be able to filter by arrival date, creation date, departure date or last update date. If you want to filter by locator, you will be able to choose to filter by Client/Buyer locator, internal locator (Inventory locator) or Provider/Channel Manager locator. Clicking the `Search` button will initiate the search.

Afterwards, it will be necessary to indicate the type and locator. As a result you will see a panel where you will be able to check the price of the booking and its details.
