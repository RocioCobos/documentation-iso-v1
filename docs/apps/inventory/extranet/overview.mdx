# Overview

The Inventory extranet allows the Buyer to access and configure the SetUp of the dynamic inventory from all the Channel Managers connected to you. You will have access to different tools, components and panels to create, modify or edit hotels, rates, rooms and sales conditions.

Also, you will find the guidelines to use the extranet to load your own contrats manually: price, availability, sales conditions.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.filter((item, i) => i > 0)}/>
