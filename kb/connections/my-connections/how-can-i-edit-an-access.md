:::warning Legacy Pull Buyers API
Please remember that when Buyer connections are established through our Legacy Pull Buyers API, updates to a given set of credentials (Hotel-X Access Codes) must be addressed not only through My Connections (at the access level), but also directly between the Buyer and Seller to ensure the information is consistent — it is not sufficient to merely update the Hotel-X Access Code in My Connections.

**How can I determine if a Buyer’s connection is Legacy or Hotel-X?**  
As a general guideline, you can verify if a given connection is Legacy or Hotel-X via our [Stats](/kb/apps/monitoring-apps/stats/stats-connectivity-dashboard) APP. Simply filter by the Buyer and select Actions > View Accesses. If you see **“clientname#suppliercode”** instead of a Hotel-X Access Code, the connection is utilizing our Hotel Pull Legacy API.

**Important:**  
Some Buyers may be transitioning from the Legacy Pull Buyers API to the Hotel-X API, which means they could have traffic via both APIs. **If in doubt, we strongly encourage you to reach out to your Buyers for more detailed information.**
