### Is the Seller's content stored in TravelgateX database?
Yes, we store the Seller's static content in our database to enhance response times and performance.

### How often is a Seller's static content updated?
Static content updates are carried out every 7-14 days, depending on the type of content.

### How often is a Seller's portfolio updated?
- Our system updates a Seller's portfolio (adding new hotels) every 7-14 days.
- Hotels that the Seller no longer provides are removed every 30 days.  

**For example, for a portfolio of 100K hotels:**

- If the Seller removes 50K, those hotels will be automatically removed from our side within the next 30 days.
- If the Seller adds 50K, those new hotels will be automatically added to the Seller's portfolio within the following 7-14 days.
