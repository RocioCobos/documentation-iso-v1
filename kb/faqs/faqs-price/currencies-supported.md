# Currencies at TravelgateX

### How can I know the currencies supported by a Seller?ðŸ”Ž
To determine the currencies supported by a particular Seller, you can utilize our [Metadata Query](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/our-methods/static-content/hotel-x-metadata-query) method or request this information directly to the Seller.

### What happens if the Seller doesn't support the currency requested in Search?ðŸ’¡
In this case, two scenarios are possible:
1. The Seller returns an error caused by the currency not being supported by them.
1. The Seller returns the currency set up on their end for your credentials.
