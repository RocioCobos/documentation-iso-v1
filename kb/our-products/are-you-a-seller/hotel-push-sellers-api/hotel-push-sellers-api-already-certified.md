# Hotel Push Sellers API: Already certified, now what?

First of all, congratulations on getting your development of the Hotel Push Sellers API certified! You are now part of the TravelgateX Network, and as a Seller you can proceed to supply your hotel inventory to the Buyers you have established a commercial relationship with.

### Mapping
Once a new Buyer has been activated, the next step will be them to map your inventory against their own codes.

### Final tests and going live
Ensuring that everything is ready for the launch is vital before going live. That's why, we always recommend to perform the final testing

Once you've confirmed that everything is working properly, then you are ready to go live!
