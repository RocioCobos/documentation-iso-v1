# Hotel Pull Sellers API: Already certified, now what?

First of all, congratulations on getting your development of the Hotel Pull Sellers API certified! You are now part of the TGX Network, and as a Seller you can proceed to supply your hotel inventory to the Buyers you have established a commercial relationship with.

:::info
At Travelgate, only one side pays for any given connectivity, and whoever assumes financial responsibility for the connection should request the activation of the connection to Travelgate - either the Buyer or the Seller.

### Mapping
Once a new Partner has been activated, the next step will be them to download your content (hotel list, destination list, room list...) and map it against their own codes.

### Final tests and going live
Ensuring that everything is ready for the launch is vital before going live. That's why, we always recommend to perform the final testing.

Once you've confirmed that everything is working properly, then you are ready to go live!
