# Booking Query: Booking List

### How can I retrieve a list of all bookings made within a specific time frame?💡
In order to obtain a list of all the reservations made within a specific time frame you should perform the Booking Query by "**typeSearch" "DATES"**. Then, simply specify if your "dateType" is either "BOOKING* (booking date) or "ARRIVAL" (check-in date), and the "start" and "end" dates of the query (yyyy-MM-dd).
