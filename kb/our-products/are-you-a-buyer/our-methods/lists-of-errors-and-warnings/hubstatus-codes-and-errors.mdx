# HubStatus codes and errors

### What are the potential hubStatus codes that can be returned in a method response?💡
- **Hubstatus 1: OK** - This code indicates that the request has been successfully executed without any Hub errors.
- **Hubstatus 2: EXCEPTION** - If you receive this code, it means that the request has encountered an uncontrolled exception at the Hub level.
- **Hubstatus 3: TIMEOUT** - This code indicates that the request has encountered a timeout error. A hubStatus code of 3 indicates that the hub timeout set by the Buyer in their request was insufficient to parse the Seller's response.
- **Hubstatus 4: UNDEFINED** - If you receive this code, it means that the request has encountered an unspecified Hub error.
### I have received a hubStatus 3 error in my Legacy Pull Buyers API response, what can I do?⚠️
To prevent hubStatus 3 errors, it is important to ensure that the Hub timeout set by the Buyer is **at least 300ms higher** than the provider timeout tag. This additional time allows for sufficient parsing of the Seller's response.
