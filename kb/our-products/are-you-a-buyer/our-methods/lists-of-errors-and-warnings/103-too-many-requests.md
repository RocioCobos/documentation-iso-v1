# 103 error - Too many requests to the supplier

### What does a 103 error mean?💡
You will encounter a 103 error in those cases your account has surpassed the agreed-upon request limit with the Seller.

**Example:**
```
<applicationErrors>
    <code>219</code>
    <type>103</type>
    <description>Too many requests to the supplier.</description>
    <httpStatusCode>0</httpStatusCode>
</applicationErrors>
```
### What can I do if I receive a 103 error in my response?✔️
1. Reach out to the Seller directly as they have the ability to adjust the QPS (Queries Per Second) limit set for your account.
1. Activate [Speed](/kb/apps/smart-traffic-apps/speed/speed-app), our intelligent cache solution, to effectively reduce response time and alleviate traffic for the concerned connection.
