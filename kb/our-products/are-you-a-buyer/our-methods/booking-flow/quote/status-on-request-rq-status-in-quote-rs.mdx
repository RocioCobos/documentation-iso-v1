## Understanding Status RQ in Quote Response
You may receive a status On Request (status RQ) in Quote response in those cases the availability of the option previously selected is pending to be confirmed by the Seller.

### The Seller returned an OK status for the option selected in Search, why do I receive a RQ Status in Quote?💡
Some Sellers may return options with an OK status in Search response, and then return a "RQ" status in Quote response. One of the reasons could be that the Seller has cached options on their side.

### What should I do if I receive a status RQ in Quote response?🔄
If you receive status RQ in Quote response, you should run a new Search request and restart the Booking Flow.
