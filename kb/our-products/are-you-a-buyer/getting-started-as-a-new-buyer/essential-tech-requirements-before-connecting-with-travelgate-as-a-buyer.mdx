### What do I need to have in place before starting my development?ðŸ’¡

TravelgateX is purely focused on connectivity so to be able to work with us via API and make the most of our Platform, you should ensure the following solutions are set up, whether in-house or outsourced:

1. **API**: Integration with Hotel-X is a must, allowing you to interact effectively with Sellers.
1. **Front solution**: You'll need a front-end setup to showcase the information obtained from the API.
1. **Booking engine**: It will be necessary to manage the reservations of your Partners.
1. **Mapping solution**: We work with the Supplier's native codes* for transparency, allowing the mapping between Buyers and Sellers to be easily optimized without interference from TravelgateX. If you can't map or prefer to use a mapping provider, we are integrated with [GIATA](/kb/getting-started-with-travelgate/About-our-Connectivity/explore-and-discover-giata-products-in-our-marketplace). You can also outsource the mapping process to companies like Vervotech, Mapping Works, or DataBindR.


:::note Mapping:

When a Seller returns the *same hotel id for different properties*, we concatenate those hotel ids with their destination code in order to make them unique. That will be the only exception where we modify the Seller information.  
In that case, the *hotelCode* will be the one returned through our API (concatenated if needed) and the *hotelCodeSupplier* will be the native code of the Supplier.  
**You should always map the "hotelCode" since it will be the one used in TravelgateX methods.**
