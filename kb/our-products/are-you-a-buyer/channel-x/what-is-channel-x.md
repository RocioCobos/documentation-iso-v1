# Channel-X Overview

Consolidate contracted products from different Channel Managers into your own system through a standardized API!

### What is Channel-X?💡

Channel-X extracts the product loaded by Channel Managers into our [Inventory](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/inventory/what-is-inventory) tool and pushes it directly into the system of a TravelgateX Partner, normally an OTA (Buyer). 

Thanks to Channel-X, you can now choose when and what product to refresh. It's a fully customizable and efficient tool in keeping your prices, availability and inventory up to date - the perfect middle-man between your system and the Channel Managers you are connected with!

Remember, Channel X is a great solution for receiving all the Inventory updates in real-time. However, if you prefer, you can also buy from our Channel Managers via our Hotel-X Pull Buyers API.This way, **you have the flexibility to choose the option that best suits your needs🚀**
