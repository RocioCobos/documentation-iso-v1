# Hotel-X Onboarding

### Find out what Hotel-X Onboarding process looks like in order to plan your development


Starting a new development project can be challenging. Accurate estimation of required resources and time is crucial to avoid inefficiencies and wasted resources. At TravelgateX, our goal is to simplify this process by providing comprehensive information, roadmap, timing for Hotel-X API development and assigning you an Onboarding Manager to support you all along the process. 


That's why we created the following step by step guide to guide you through the development journey, ensuring efficient and timely project completion. 
 
 ## Connectivity Set Up panel

Our Hotel-X onboarding process consists of three distinct steps:

1. Hotel-X Development
1. First Partner Connection
1. Go Live

By following these three steps, we ensure that you have the necessary knowledge and tools to successfully utilize Hotel-X and manage your operations independently through our Network.


To facilitate your progress through the onboarding process, we have developed the Connectivity Set Up panel, which will automatically appear when you log in to our Network.

Within this panel, you will find the three essential steps of the Hotel-X onboarding process, along with dedicated resources and information for each step.

If you need to temporarily minimize the panel, simply click on the "Finish Onboarding Later" button:

## Hotel-X Development

As part of our onboarding process, each step undergoes a certification process to ensure its quality and effectiveness. However, it is important to note that only the Booking Flow step is mandatory for certification.

We prioritize the certification of the Booking Flow step as it directly impacts the core functionality and essential operations within Hotel-X. This step involves the crucial processes of searching, quoting, and booking, and it is imperative to meet our standards of accuracy and reliability.

:::tip
While the certification process for other steps is optional, **we highly recommend** completing the certification for each step to maximize the benefits and capabilities of Hotel-X. These certifications contribute to a robust and seamless integration, allowing you to fully leverage the functionalities and features available.

The completion of the entire development process typically takes an average of 25 days. It is important to note that the total duration can vary based on the resources allocated to the project. In our experience, we have witnessed a range of development timelines, with some clients successfully completing their projects in as little as 7 days, while others typically take around 2 weeks.

It is worth mentioning that certain projects may require more extensive development and, consequently, a longer time frame extending into months. Rest assured, our team will work closely with you to assess your specific needs and allocate the appropriate resources to ensure a timely and efficient completion of the development phase.

The development of Hotel-X API comprises **three essential steps**, each focusing on specific aspects:

1. Content
1. Booking Flow
1. Booking Management

### Content üè®
This step involves obtaining and processing information through query acquaintance and mapping logic. The [Content methods](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/content/overview) will allow you to retrieve static information from the Sellers, like the hotel list or the destination list.

Due to the intricacies involved, the Content step is typically the most time-consuming. On average, Buyers developing Hotel-X spend approximately 12 days in this phase.


### Booking Flow üöÄ

The [Booking Flow](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/booking-flow/overview) step consists of two queries (Search and Quote) and one mutation (Book). Our Buyers typically allocate an average of 8 days to complete this step.


### Booking Management üîé

The [Booking Management](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/booking-management/overview) step involves a query and a mutation, specifically Booking (booking details and list) and Cancel (cancellation). Among the Booking Management methods, you can also find the Amendment operations. On average, Buyers developing Hotel-X spend approximately 5 days in this step.


## First Partner Connection

Through this pivotal step, we facilitate the establishment of the initial connection between you and the Seller you have an agreement with. Ensuring seamless communication and data exchange between the two platforms.

:::info
For a comprehensive understanding of how to establish your first connection, please refer to our [Quick guide to auto-connections](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations).
:::

Upon successful testing of the methods during the auto-connection process, the connection of a new Partner can be swiftly established within a matter of minutes or hours. However, in the event that any issues arise during this process, our diligent Activations team will conduct a manual review to resolve them. Please note that this manual review may extend the delivery time for the connection.

### Go Live!

The final stage of our Hotel-X onboarding process is designed to ensure a smooth go-live experience with Hotel-X. During this crucial phase, our team offers extensive support to enhance your API integration for seamless functionality. We will assist you through testing procedures to maintain the integrity and reliability of the integration.

:::info Key phases:
- Mapping
- Testing
- First Booking
:::

After successfully completing the mapping and testing steps, the subsequent step entails conducting your first live reservations with your Seller. As you proceed with live bookings, rest assured that our team will closely monitor the process to ensure its smooth operation.

To provide you with valuable insights and transparency, we have implemented an automated update feature within the Connectivity Set Up panel. Once you reach a milestone of 10 bookings, this panel will be automatically updated to reflect the following page where we will ask you for your feedback:

## Account configuration üõ†Ô∏è

As part of the Hotel-X onboarding process, we kindly request that you update your Company Profile information. This ensures that your details are accurate and up to date, enabling us to provide you with the best possible support and tailored experience. In oder to do so, please follow the indications provided in the article "[How to edit & customize your Company Profile](/kb/account-settings/company-profile/how-to-edit-and-customize-profile)".
