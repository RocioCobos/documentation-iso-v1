# Hotel-X Booking Management Certification

### Find out what you need to get your Booking Management step certified.

To ensure a successful collaboration, it is crucial that our Partners have a full understanding of our API, can effectively utilize it, and transmit accurate information. That's why we require all Partners connecting to our platform, whether they are buying or selling in our Marketplace, to undergo a certification process.

### When to apply💡

You should apply once you've finished the implementation of the Booking Management methods.

Since the Booking Management methods are optional, you have the flexibility to choose which ones you want to implement. However, we **highly recommend** implementing them to avoid manual cancellations and the need to contact the Seller for booking details. It will streamline your process and enhance efficiency.

### What aspects will be examined during the Certification?🔎

- Usage of general data structure of our API
- Correct application of the criteria options
- Enabled GZIP compression header

### What information do we need to provide for the Certification?
