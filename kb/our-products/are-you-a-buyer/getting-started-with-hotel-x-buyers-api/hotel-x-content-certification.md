# Hotel-X Content Certification

### Why is Content Certification important?📑

Content Certification is important to ensure a successful collaboration, since it is crucial for our Partners to have a comprehensive understanding of our API, be able to effectively utilize it, and transmit accurate information. That's why we have made it mandatory for all Partners, whether they are buying or selling in our Marketplace, to undergo a certification process.

### When to apply?💡

You should apply once you've finished the implementation of the content methods. Since content methods are optional, you have the flexibility to choose which ones you want to implement. However, we highly **recommend implementing them** to prevent any data discrepancies and the need for manual updates.

### What information will we check?🔎
- Usage of general data structure of our API
- Correct application of the pagination
- Correct application of the filtering and criteria options
- Enabled GZIP compression header

### What information do you need to provide for the Certification?
