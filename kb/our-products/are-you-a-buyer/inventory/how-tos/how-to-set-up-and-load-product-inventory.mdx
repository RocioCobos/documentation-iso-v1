### For how long can I load product into Inventory?
Our Inventory system allows you to load allotment and prices for **up to 2 years** from the current date.

### Is there any Remarks field for the rate/room in the Inventory API?
There isn't a dedicated Remarks field at the room level in Inventory. However, you can add remarks at the reservation request level. If needed, the room name field can be utilized to include room-specific details as free text.

### I have not received a booking notification in my email, what can I do?
1. Check your setup for this hotel in the Extranet: Ensure that the Hotel Email, CC Address, and From Address are correct. If they are not, [update the information](/docs/apps/inventory/extranet/set-up/setup#how-to-add-a-hotel) to ensure that booking notifications reach the expected emails.
2. Check the Spam and Trash folders: Make sure you haven't accidentally blocked or filtered the booking notification emails.
3. Technical issues: If you have checked the above two points and the information is correctly set up, there might be a technical issue preventing the emails from being sent properly.  

If after reviewing these steps, you still do not receive the booking confirmation emails, feel free to contact our Customer Care team through [Tickets](https://app.travelgatex.com/tickets) for further investigation.
