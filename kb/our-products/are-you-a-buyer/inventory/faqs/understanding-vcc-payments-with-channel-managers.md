# Understanding VCC Payment and commission with Channel Managers

### How can I determine if a Channel Manager supports VCC payment?💡
To confirm if a specific Channel Manager allows VCC payment, you should directly contact them. Only Channel Managers that have implemented the ReservationNotif method can enable VCC payment.

### If a Channel Manager offers a VCC solution, can we still negotiate a regular credit agreement with the supplier (e.g. payment 10 days after arrival instead of VCC on arrival)?⭐
If the Channel Manager allows card payment, we accept all payment options. You can configure BookingDatePayment and ArrivalDatePayment at a rate level in the Inventory Extranet. However, please note that we do not get involved in the payment terms between the Channel Manager and the Buyer. It is advisable to confirm this directly with your Channel Manager.

### Can you provide a list of Channel Managers that offer VCC payment via TravelgateX?🔎

### Which Channel Managers are capable of handling commission? Can we only use net prices for all Channel Managers?🛠️
In our system, the Channel Manager (CM) is responsible for loading availability and prices and then you have the flexibility to set a commission at the rate level on the Inventory extranet. This means that if the CM loads net prices, you can add a commission percentage in the rate configuration. As a result, you will receive the price both with and without commission via API.
