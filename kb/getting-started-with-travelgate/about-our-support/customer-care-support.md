# Customer Care Support

## Understand how your tech requests are handled at TravelgateX

### What resources are offered to Partners once they connect to our Marketplace?üåü
1. **Help Center:** the home to our Knowledge Base & FAQs.
1. **[Tickets](https://app.travelgatex.com/tickets):** open tickets to our Customer Care team and manage them through our APP section "Tickets".
3. **[TravelgateX Community](https://community.travelgatex.com/):** post ideas & suggestions, check out new feature releases, and stay updated with announcements from our Product Team.

### What does TravelgateX not do?üõ†Ô∏è
Our core focus lies in providing **seamless connectivity solutions**. As a result, we don't offer services like booking engine, voucher generator system, front/back-office systems, website design, etc.

Nevertheless, we have established partnerships with numerous affiliates who specialize in these domains, and we would be more than happy to connect you with them.

### How are Partner requests categorized at TravelgateX?üí°
1. **Product Development:** This involves any development work aimed at enhancing, adding, or modifying functionalities of an existing product and/or service. For example:
	- "I would like to have the option to download more than 50 logs at once from our logs manager"
	- API New Major Version release for an existing integration (e.g. v1.0 to v2.0).

1. **Product Maintenance:** This encompasses any development efforts focused on ensuring the proper performance of an existing product and/or service. For example:
	- Booking flow data discrepancy.
	- Static data download error/discrepancy.
