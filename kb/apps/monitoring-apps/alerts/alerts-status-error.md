### Use cases of status error code alerts:

1. **Alert if a status code exceeds a specific % of the total traffic in the last X minutes**. E.g: "I want to check if status code 102 (Seller error) exceeds 10% of my Search traffic in the last 60 minutes and also I want to check it every 60 minutes. Only alert if there are at least 1000 requests in the time window to be reviewed."

    - **Error Code To Check:** Set the error codes to be checked by the alert. In our example: transactions with error code 102 will be checked.
    - **Deviation %:** The minimum percentage to consider status "alerting". In our example: 10%.
    - **Frequency:** How often the alert values will be checked, in minutes. In our example:
        - If we set 60 minutes, the alert will check the conditions each hour of the last 60 minutes of traffic (time window).
        - If we set 30 minutes, the alert will check the conditions each half hour of the last 60 minutes of traffic (time window).
    - **Time Window:** Period in the past (minutes) over which alert values are checked. In our example: 60 minutes.
    - **Minimum number of requests:** Minimum number of requests that should be in the window to be reviewed. In our example, there should be at least 1000 transactions in those 60 minutes for the alert to check the conditions.

1. **Alert if specific error results exceed a specific % of the total traffic in the last X requests**. E.g.: I want to check if status code 102 (Seller error) exceeds 10% of my Search traffic in the last 1000 transactions.

1. **Alert if, in the last X minutes, specific status codes exceed a specific % during the previous X minutes.** E.g.: I want to check if status code 105 (Seller error) has increased by at least 10% over the last 60 minutes compared with the previous 60 minutes. Check it every 60 minutes. Only alert if there are at least 1000 requests in the time window to be reviewed.
